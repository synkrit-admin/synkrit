Headings/Subheadings: Use Poppins for headings to create a modern, stylish, and eye-catching look. Its geometric shapes make it visually striking without compromising readability.

Body Text: For body content, use Inter or Open Sans. Both of these fonts are designed for optimal readability in paragraphs and will ensure a clean reading experience across different devices.

Navigation and Buttons: Montserrat would be ideal for navigation menus and buttons because of its versatility and slightly playful feel, which adds a modern touch without being too decorative.
